I vibecoded the heck out of the project with Google Gemini. This is a game called Dong Dong that I've played with Rummikub tiles, but wanted to replicate online. 

I haven't found any other versions of the game online, so I had to develop my own engine/front end. Please don't try to break it, it is very fragile lol.

The game is officially deployed on Render, and can be played by first [activating the backend](https://dong-dong-backend.onrender.com). Only once the backend is activated can you access the official website: https://dong-dong-frontend.onrender.com.
