I vibecoded the heck out of the project with Google Gemini. This is a game called Dong Dong that I've played with Rummikub tiles, but wanted to replicate online. 

I haven't found any other versions of the game online, so I had to develop my own engine/front end. Please don't try to break it, it is very fragile lol.
